(1) At first use user_id to load the page. If so, however, anyone who login can access other people's main page by using the index. Then we change to use session to get the user_id.

1/27:
(1) Arrival time need to be later than present time
(2) Max passenger for an order is 10
(3) Disable corresponding form with different character, including driver, sharer and owner
(4) After confirmed, no one can change anything except driver can edit completed

1/28:
(1) Mainpage only show open orders

(3) Check the maximum number of the passenger is 10, and if exceed after sharer or owner edit the number, message shown
(4) Check all the forms and give corresponding message if input is invalid
(5) Validation picture to judge whether register user is humanbeing
